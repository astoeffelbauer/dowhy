    "Alice who experiences intense eye-dryness decides to use a tele-medicine online platform, as she is not able to visit an eye doctor where she lives. She goes through the steps of reporting her medical history (whether she has a rare allergy, for Alice Condition = 1) and the platform in the end recommends to her two possible eye drops, with slightly different ingredients (option 'A' and option 'B'). Alice does a quick search online and she finds that the are many positive reviews for option 'A'. Nevertheless, she decides to use option 'B' (Treatment = 2) as her mother has also used it in the past and it had positive results. After a couple of days Alice's vision becomes much better and her symptoms start to disappear. However she is very curious what would have happened if she had used the very popular option 'A' instead, or even did nothing.\n",
